# Aura Devices

The Aura device is weared by the patient and collects plenty of physiological signals which will feed our algorithms in order to provide all Aura services. We can divide our developments into 2 steps which are detailled in the following paragraphs.

### Step 1 : Collect and Connect

The device collect the physiological signals and send these data to our cloud services \(thanks to the Aura Gateway\) or the Aura Mobile App. This first step will be used to develop our detection algorithms and on market devices will be used.

### Step 2 : Collect and Detect

The device collect physiological signals and apply a personnalized algorithm in order to classify a situation into a seizure probability scale. The device will be able to notify the patient by itself or to communicate alerts to the patient's smartphone. All data collected will be upload to the cloud in order to provide smart long-term services.

# Aura Devices

The Aura device is weared by the patient and collects plenty of physiological signals which will feed our algorithms in order to provide all Aura services. We can divide our developments into 2 steps which are detailled in the following paragraphs.

### Step 1 : Collect and Connect

The device collects the physiological signals and send data to our cloud services \(thanks to the Gateway or the Mobile App\). This step will be used to develop our detection algorithms and on-market devices will be used.

### Step 2 : Collect and Detect

The device collects physiological signals and is able to apply a personnalized algorithm in order to classify a situation into a seizure probability scale. During situation where risks are detected, the device will be able to notify the patient by itself or to communicate alerts to the patient's smartphone. All data collected will be upload to the cloud in order to provide smart long-term services.

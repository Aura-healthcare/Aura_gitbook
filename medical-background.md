# Medical background


## Monitoring physiological signs
We review the state of the art regarding epilepsy seizure surveillance in order to select a set of physiological signs to monitor continuously.

* **Heart rate and Heart rate variability** are key data to measure disturbances of the autonomic nervous system, an early sign of epilepsy seizure.[1][2]

* **Electro dermal activity** is already use to detect epilepsy seizure[3][4]. We also have strong clues that it will be a good sign to anticipate the seizure[5]

* **Skin Dermal Temperature** will provide useful informations on the patient activity and environment

* **Body motion** will provide useful informations on the patient activity. It is already use to detect abnormal body motion occurring during specific epilepsy seizure[3]


## Sensor benchmark
In order to collect patients physiological samples, we set up a dual approach.
On a first cohort, we will record physiological informations with **FDA/CE Medical approved devices**. Each prototype will be expensive but will ensure the feasibility of the prediction algorithm on very high quality data.

On a second cohort, we will record physiological informations with **top quality trackers**. We will develop a solution for a reasonable price that could be industrialized straight-forward.

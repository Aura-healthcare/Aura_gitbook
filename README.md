According to World Health Organization, Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that affects around 6 millions people of all ages and social conditions in Europe\[1\]. In France, we count 400 000 epileptic patients\[2\].

### Living with Epilepsy

Patient living conditions are difficult due to **unpredictability** **of epilepsy seizures**.

They cause:

* many accidents in daily life \(falls, burns, ...\)
* social exclusion
  * from the others due to fear provoked by theses seizures
  * from the educational and work environment because of the risks resulting from unadapted logistics 
* permanent life-threatning danger. An untreated long-lasting epilepsy seizure episode can lead to fatal complications \(SUDEP\). Each year, 33 000 people died from this disease in Europe\[3\]

Epilespy is also very impacting for the patient relatives who:

* lives with a constant fear from upcoming seizure 
* organizes their lifes in order to take care and support the patients 

### Treatments

Medicine is the most common way of treating epilepsy. It prevents or stop seizures in 80% of patients.

They are also alternatives treatments:

* Surgery 
* Vagal Nerve Stimulation implants 
* Ketogenic diet 
* Complementary health approachs 

### Where Aura Solution can help

Aura doesn't cure epilepsy, because it doesn't stop seizures. But it provides informations about the disease and helps patients to better live with it. Our goal is to help parents to take care of their epileptic childrens, help people who medicine can't help, help people until they find an effective medical treatment...

So we 't help. Aura won't stop seizures but will provide usefull information to patients about their diseases. We will help patients without solutions to better live with their disease.

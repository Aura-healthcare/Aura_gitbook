According to World Health Organization, Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that affects around 6 millions people of all ages and social conditions in Europe\[1\]. In France, we count 400 000 epileptic patients\[2\].

### Living with Epilepsy

Patient living conditions are difficult due to **unpredictability** **of epilepsy seizures**.

They cause:

* many accidents in daily life \(falls, burns, ...\)
* social exclusion
  * from the others due to fear provoked by theses seizures
  * from the educational and work environment because of the lack of
* permanent life-threatning danger. An untreated long-lasting epilepsy seizure episode can lead to fatal complications \(SUDEP\). Each year, 33 000 people died from this disease in Europe\[3\]

Epilespy is also very impacting for the patient relatives who:

* lives with a constant fear from upcoming seizure 
* organizes their lifes in order to take care and support the patients 

### Treatments

Medicine is the most common way of treating epilepsy. It prevents or stop seizures in 80% of patients.

They are also alternatives treatments:

* Surgery 
* Vagal Nerve Stimulation implants 
* Ketogenic diet 
* Complementary health approachs

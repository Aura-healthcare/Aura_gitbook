# Aura Gateway

## Pre-requisites

In order to communicate with the Aura Server, the Gateway needs an internet connection with at least one of the following communication link :

* Wifi and/or Ethernet over FAI box ; and/or

* 2G/3G/4G over mobile network \(mobile operator data subscription requiered\) .

If several links are used, the Gateway will be able to manage failure of one of them by switching to another link \(enhanced reliability of the communication link\).

## User Experience

#### Gateway configuration

The Gateway requiers a configuration step before beeing totally autonomous. During this phase the user will :

* Configure wifi access to the FAI box if used ;
* Configure access to 2G/3G/4G network if used ;
* Link the owned Aura Devices to the Gateway ;
* Link the Gateway to the user session on the Cloud. 

## Functionnalities

The Aura Gateway is a platform dedicated to management of Aura Devices and safe/reliable communication with Aura server or mobile app.

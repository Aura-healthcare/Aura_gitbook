# Aura Gateway

## Pre-requisites

* Wifi and/or Ethernet over FAI box ; and/or

* 2G/3G/4G over mobile network \(mobile operator data subscription requiered\) .

If several links are used, the Gateway will be able to manage failure of one of them by switching to another link \(enhanced reliability of the communication link\).

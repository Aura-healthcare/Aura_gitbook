The "Aura" Solution is developped as a Class 2a Medical Device. In order to get the certification, we are working hard in the implementation of a "Startup Adapted" Quality Management System ensuring the global solution meets user expectations and safety requirements along each stage of development. All part of the global solution is developped with a high quality objective \(hardware, embedded software, cloud software, documentations, ...\). Here are the main norms wich drives our developpements :

* European reglementation :
  * Directive 93/42/CEE ;
  * ISO 13485 : Quality Management Systems ;
  * IEC 62304 : Software life cycle processes ;
  * IEC 14971 : Medical Device Risk Management ;
  * IEC 60601-1 \(and 60601-x\) : General Requirements for Safety ;
  * ...

* FDA reglementation : 
  * 510\(k\) ;

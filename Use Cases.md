# Use Cases

The Aura project is a set of smart objects designed to help epileptic patients. After a short self-learning period and by monitoring physiological informations like ECG, EDA, Respiration Rate, Body Temperature, Movements, ... the Aura Solution will be able to detect seizures and alert patient several minutes before it occurs.

The following chapters will introduce the two main use cases considered for the Aura Project.

### **Monitoring for epileptic childrens**

Aura Wristband is able to detect seizures several minutes before it happens and can alert parents thanks to the mobile app. The communication between the monitoring device and the mobile app is enforced by a dedicated gateway \(Aura Gateway\).

### **Self monitoring for epileptic patients**

Aura Wristband is able to detect seizures several minutes before it happens and can alert patients thanks to the mobile app. Because in this use case both wristband and smartphone are "weared" by the patient, no gateway is required. This mode is totally mobile.
